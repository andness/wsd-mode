Model processes through simple sequence-scripts like this:

And get pretty diagrams like this generated for you:

If that sounds interesting and you want to know how that works,
feel free to read along.

** Features

The major-mode provides the following features:

- proper syntax highlighting for all WSD syntax.
- indentation based on nested constructs and alternative paths.
- supports running Emacs in GUI and the terminal.
- auto-generating diagrams based on source.
- inline rendering in Emacs frames when possible, with fallback to OS or
  browser for viewing when critical features are unavailable.
- ~org-babel~ support (use ~wsd~ as language).

** Installation

wsd-mode can be installed as a package, from Marmalade, MELPA and MELPA stable.

Installation from MELPA will be a development snapshot and always be latest version.
Versions available from Marmalade and MELPA stable should match, and be more stable versions
released at less frequent intervals.

To install the package, simply start Emacs and issue the following command:

~M-x package-install <RET> wsd-mode <RET>~.

** Usage

Using wsd-mode is very easy. Either create a new buffer and activate using
~M-x wsd-mode~, or open a new file with a ~.wsd~ extension. For files with
a ~.wsd~ extension wsd-mode is activated automatically.

Once the mode is active, type along as you would otherwise do on
[[websequencediagrams.com]].
